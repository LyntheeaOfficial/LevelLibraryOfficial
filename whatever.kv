Currently, the uses of popular A.I. platforms is to be an alternative to google. These A.I. provide the user with quick answers to questions they may have. While this is good, popular A.I. fails to suffice the needs of more professional environments. Other pages of the Level Library assess this issue. However, we did not want to get rid of the already well known A.I. interface and its uses with the creation of our solution but rather make it a better tool for professional and scientific environments."

It has been reported that rural areas often don’t have the resources and teachers available for people in the country to use. This forces those who come from rural areas to spend excess time and money moving away from their homes to receive an education and sometimes not returning because of better opportunities elsewhere. Giving rural areas these resources allows them to build a space for these teachers and scientists to have a successful life and teach more people from their areas at a better cost to them. Giving this possibility for better education in these rural areas means that there can be a quicker and wider spread of knowledge allowing them to catch up and be on the same page as everyone else."
